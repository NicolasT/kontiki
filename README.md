Kontiki
=======
The [Kontiki] project aims to provide a [Haskell] implementation of the [Raft]
distributed consensus protocol.

This implementation is based on the paper "In Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)" by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout,
a copy of which can be found in the `papers` directory.
